SK Learn 

sklearn.tree : classifier and regressor

sklearn.model_selection
	train_test_split

	cross validation 
		shuffle split : stratified or normal
		kfold split : stratified and normal

	grid search CV. n_jobs = -1 parallelise across different parameter combination
	randomised search CV

	cross_val_score

	cross_val_predict : only works with kfold

sklearn.ensemble

	random forest : regressor and classifier. oob_score helps in getting the generalisation error.
			  
	bagging : classifier and regressor. n_hobs = -1


sklearn.metrics
	classification : classification_report, confusion matrix, f1_score

	regression : mean_squared_error

Sklear: NearestNeighbors : regressor and classification
